    "Dream Housing Finance company deals in all kinds of home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first applies for home loan and after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan.Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have provided a dataset to identify the customers segments that are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. \n",

    "## Variable review and hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided dataset contains 13 variables. There are 12 dependent/explanatory variables and the response/target variable (Loan Status), which indicates whether the loan has been approved or not. We are, therefore, in front of a binary classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependent variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Gender: Male/Female. \n",
    "-Married: Applicant married (Y/N)\n",
    "-Education: Applicant Education (Graduate/ Under Graduate)\n",
    "-Self Employed: Self employed (Y/N)\n",
    "-Dependent: Number of dependents\n",
    "-Applicant Income:Applicant income\n",
    "-CoApplicant Income:Coapplicant income\n",
    "-Loan Amount: Loan amount in thousands\n",
    "-Loan Term: Term of loan in months\n",
    "-Credit History: credit history meets guidelines\n",
    "-Property Area: Urban/ Semi Urban/ Rural\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of this variables can be indicative that the a borrower is less likely to default? We can establish several hypothesis that we will have the opportunity to test later when we conduct the variable analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "-We could presume that higher incomes (applicant income+coapplicant income) to have bigger chances of approval. However, we need to keep in consideration the loan amount as well. Having a high income but also a big loan amount may be riskier than having a lower income with a also lower loan amount. On that light, seems more reasonable to assume that the lower loan to income ratio of the applicant, the a bigger chance to receive the approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "-In addition to the higher income that comes with a coapplication, having a coapplicant also means that in case that one of the applicants losses his or her job, the ability to support the loan is less affected. Therefore we can expect that applications with coapplicant to have a better chance of approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Marital status shouldn't have any influence by itself. However, most likely married applicants will have a bigger percentage of coapplicants an in that sense the assumption made for applications with coapplicants above could also be reflected here.\n",
    "\n",
    "-To have a Graduate is usually related to have a higher income salary and therefore all applicants with graduate should have a higher ratio of approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Self employed normally have a more variable income, and lenders preference is to lend to borrowers who have a steady source of income. We can anticipate to see taht self employed applicants have less chance of receiving an approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Number of dependents should no have an impact. Whatsmore, there are mortgage discrimination rules that prevent to use certain aspects to deny or set the terms of a credit. However, number of dependents might be correlated to a higher income to debt ratio. Also higher number of dependents can be related to a bigger house, which means a bigger house price, which means a bigger loan amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Longer loan terms usually pose more risk to the lender just because the risk exposure time to default is longer. At the same time, shorter loan terms require higher installments. If we the total loan amount by the loan term, we can get an approximated idea of monthly installment and see which proportion of the income represents. We don't know the country where the company operates but in the US, lenders prefer that household expense payments (mostly rent or mortgage payments) don't exceed 28% of the monthly or annual income. Therefore, we expect to see thar applicants with lower percentage of loan payment (loan amount divided by loan term) to income to have a higher ratio of approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Credit History variable description says \"credit history meets guidelines\". It is not totally clear if this variable is a scoring such a FICO or parameter which is determined using different criterias. In any case, since somehow it's related to the \"credibility\" of the lender to return the loan, we can expect this variable to have a considerable effect in the approval decission.\n",
    "\n",
    "After having quickly examined the variables, it's worth mentioning that there is important information missing. For example, there is no value of the property information to estimate the loan-to-value ratio, which is an crucial parameter. Neither is information about the total debt of the applicant(s) (debt comming from other sources, for example a carr loan, a student loan...) to determine the Payments-to-Income ratio. Information about the downpayment amount is also missing... So our first action should be going back to the credit or risk department of the lender company and request this additional information. But since this is just an exercise and not the real life we shall proceed to the analysis with the information what we have."

    "- Exhaustive Feature Selection, is a wrapper approach for brute-force evaluation of feature subsets. . For instance, if the classifier is a logistic regression and the dataset consists of 4 features, the alogorithm will evaluate all 15 feature combinations"

    "After trying and testing 4 different algorithms, the best accuracy on the public leaderboard is achieved by Logistic Regression (0.7847), followed by RandomForest (0.7778) and XGBoost (0.7778), and Decision Tree performed the worst (0.6458). While new features created via feature engineering helped in predicting the target variable, it did not improve the overall model accuracy much. Compared to using default parameter values, GridSearchCV helped improved the model's mean validation accuracy by providing the optimized values for the model's hyperparameters. On the whole, a logistic regression classifier provides the best result in terms of accuracy for the given dataset, without any feature engineering needed. Because of its simplicity and the fact that it can be implemented relatively easy and quick, Logistic Regression is often a good baseline that data scientists can use to measure the performance of other more complex algorithms. In this case, however, a basic Logistic Regression has already outperformed other more complex algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost, for the given dataset.\n",
